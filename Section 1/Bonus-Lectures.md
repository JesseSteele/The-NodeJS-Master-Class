# NEW: Bonus Lectures

The changes to Node since 2018 have not been substantive enough to merit releasing a whole new version of this course (see previous slide for details). Eventually (someday) Node will release a huge change that makes us need to redevelop the course, but that hasn't happened yet.

That being said, there are a few topics we wished we'd addressed in this course, but didn't. So we've created bonus lectures for them and put them on Youtube. These are answers to common issues that students run into as they take this course. You can ignore these lectures for now. But just be aware that they're here if/when you need them:


## TypeError: Cannot convert object to primitive value
